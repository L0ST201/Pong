## How do I test this application?
Simply clone the repository and run it in your preferred IDE and then the file directory will be loaded. After that, navigate the directory by clicking "game/" and then "Pong/". This will then launch the game as a result. Your paddle is located on the left side of the game board, and to move it up or down, simply move the mouse and the paddle will follow. To launch the ball, simply left-click your mouse, and it will launch from the starting point in the center of the board. You will next use the mouse to maneuver your paddle and strike the ball and attempt to score before the CPU. When one of you scores, the ball will be reset to the middle of the board but will now display a new score based on whether the CPU or a player score.
