Functional User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to play a game the resembles the original game of pong for entertainment purposes. I also would like to have the game be more interactive by displaying the score on the game board.
Example 1 
Given: Pong Game data available 
When: The user starts/runs the Pong game.
Then: The window should load a working application.
Example 2 
Given: Pong Game data available
When: The user left clicks the ball will launch.
Then: The user moves the paddle with the mouse, it only travels up or down in the same direction as the cursor.
Example 3 
Given: Pong Game data available
When: The user misses the ball and it hits the users boundary point 
Then: The ball then reset, and the score will now show 0 for the player and 1 for CPU.
Example 4

When: The user continues the game, and to launch the ball, the user left clicks once more, but this time the score is 0-1 in favor of the CPU. This time, though, the user reaches the CPU's boundary point.

How do I test this application?
Simply clone the repository and run it in your preferred IDE and then the file directory will be loaded. After that, navigate the directory by clicking "game/" and then "Pong/". This will then launch the game as a result. Your paddle is located on the left side of the game board, and to move it up or down, simply move the mouse and the paddle will follow. To launch the ball, simply left-click your mouse, and it will launch from the starting point in the center of the board. You will next use the mouse to maneuver your paddle and strike the ball and attempt to score before the CPU. When one of you scores, the ball will be reset to the middle of the board but will now display a new score based on whether the CPU or a player score.
